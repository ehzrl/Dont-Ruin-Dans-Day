Ever since Dan was little, he has kept an extensive list of everything he hates. The full list is so long, it's impossible to fit on any screen. However, there are a few things he likes. Here's the comprehensive list:
Dan likes:
- White Noise
- Only one of the Muppets
- Working
The latter of which is in jeopardy, because his new boss is enforcing the whole company to take the day off today. What's a guy like Dan, who only likes three things, to do with his new free time? Is he capable of having a good day?
